The game above spans 6 monitors. Each monitor has its own computer. Players can jump from monitor
to monitor and walk up and down a large level.

[You can download that sample here](http://github.com/greggman/hft-tonde-iko).

If you `hft add` it to your happyfuntimes, then run happyfuntimes and click
on the game you'll get a launcher screen that looks like this.

This is the standard `game.html` and `scripts/game.js`. I did this because
setting up and testing multiple machines is a pain in the ass so I wanted
an easy way to test stuff.

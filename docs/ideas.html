      <p>At the time I wrote this &quot;ideas&quot; document I hadn&#39;t made many games. I&#39;ve spent
the last 4 months making infrustucture. But, there&#39;s a ton of ideas. I&#39;m sure
you have more but just throw some ideas out and get yourself imagining stuff...</p>
<p>First off, the 3 <em>games</em> I&#39;ve made so far, PowPow, BoomBoom, JumpJump are basically
classic games with more players. But, with a system like HappyFunTimes where you
can have 10, 20, 50, 100 players other things come to mind.</p>
<p>For example playing JumpJump with 25 players is barely managable. Too many people
are on the screen. But what about team games? 5 people per team? What about
social games? Ask people to go around the room and click things on each other&#39;s phones
or find stuff.</p>
<p>So some random ideas I&#39;d like to explore if I have time. Maybe they&#39;ll trigger some
ideas for you</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shake phone to race</p>
<p>The faster you shake the faster it goes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Balance platforms with balls melodic.</p>
<p>Each player controls one platform they can place and rotate with their phone. Balls bounce off them,
Or rain producing sounds. Think elektroplancton</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bucket brigade</p>
<p>Players have to pass things from player to player either on the big screen or on their own</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Given at least 4 players divide into groups.</p>
<p>Make up phone configuration in gamer. Tell users to arrange their phones.</p>
<p>Put a number on each phone and a diagram</p>
<pre><code>+----+
|    |    +----+
| 1  +----+    |
|    |    | 3  |
+----+ 2  |    |
     |    +----+
     +----+
</code></pre><p>Then, players push a character from on phone to the next or flick a ball.
Teams that make the most laps win or points win</p>
</li>
<li><p>Number the phones, have players stand in a circle by number.</p>
<p>Play some Kind of pass the ball game where the server passes things around
the circle and players have to forward them. Maybe like pong ?
Maybe with orientation ? Maybe catch with basket then throw?</p>
<p>If players stand I circle could let players target each other because can guess
where they are in relation to each other</p>
<p>Could limit to groups of ~12, split groups?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Game that players lineup their screens to figure out code. Maybe color background by team/group</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Go Fish</p>
<p>Collect every pair of cards? There are 2 of each card. Walk around the room and
exchange cards. Maybe the shared screens shows who&#39;s in lead or number of cards
to go or soethng.</p>
<p>Need to know if I can do it.</p>
<p>Maybe you have to bump phones, then it says &quot;paired with <name>&quot;. Then you can
ask &quot;do you have any 4s?&quot;  &quot;Go fish!&quot;  You each ask for a card, then it exchanges,
then it unpairs and you can&#39;t pair with the same person until you&#39;ve paired with
someone else?</p>
<p>How can I make it social. I&#39;d prefer if you can&#39;t cheat so you&#39;d pick the card
on your screen you want to match. And it would tell you? Or maybe the other person
would have to answer but if they lie there&#39;s some penalty or something?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fist bump game</p>
<p>using accelerometers and synced clock maybe we can tell when
two people fist bump? Heck, maybe if 3 or more people have
the same time stamp we can assume all of them bumped?</p>
<p>Players have to fist bump everyone?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Games with physical movements</p>
<p>Players must turn around (use compass / device orientation).
Of course players can just turn their phones. Maybe they have
to hold them level (put dot on the screen with a circle, keep
circle in the dot as they are instructed to turn left, turn right,
jump, etc...</p>
</li>
<li><p>Just press button most times?</p>
<p>various track and field / hyper bishi bashi games</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find your name on other person&#39;s phone. Fist bump.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find your picture on other person&#39;s phone.</p>
<p>iOS Safari can&#39;t do pictures yet</p>
</li>
<li><p>game where players have to find matching piece of puzzle.</p>
<p>Example for groups of 3 players they might see</p>
<pre><code>+---+  +---+  +---+   Picture of 3 phones side by side.
|   |  |   |  |   |   with some image that fits just those
| &lt;-|  |-O-|  |-&gt; |   3 phones.
|   |  |   |  |   |
|   |  |   |  |   |
+---+  +---+  +---+
</code></pre><p>You have to walk around the room and find your matching partners.
Maybe make it easier by matching background colors. First find all the red players,
then figure how to align the phones to see the image.</p>
<p>Not sure what you&#39;d do at that point. Type the message that&#39;s across N
displays. Or maybe trace some line across all 3? Hard to do unless you
set the phones down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>game where you slide character from one phone to the other by sliding finger across both phones</p>
<p>Variation of above idea. If you know 2 phones are partners then you could slide
your finger from one to the other to drag a character across screens. The game would
know the 2 controllers belong together and based on time (syncedclock) and where fingers
are dragged could tell if you dragged from the correct N phones.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Racing up or down screen using device orientation for steering</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use device orientation like a paddle controller. Tilting left
right moves basket across screen. Pressing button puts your
basket high for a moment. Try to catch more falling things than other
players? Think Kaboom</p>
</li>
<li><p>drawing game.</p>
<p>Player&#39;s draw on their phone, add drawing to level? Maybe Crayon Physics like?
Heck, just stop erasing the canvas with the simple example. Problem. Penises</p>
</li>
<li><p>racing game</p>
<p>maybe like micro machines or moto roader where the camera keeps up with the lead
and others get put in place.</p>
<p>like grand prix, tiny cars on a track the fits on the screen</p>
</li>
<li><p>More co-op games or team games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>rapunzel</p>
<p>Rapunzel was a basic programming tutorial where you&#39;d be told the wind
and height above ground of Rapunzel&#39;s window and you&#39;d have to type in
the angle and power of the bow to shoot an arrow into her window.</p>
<p>That&#39;s been updated by a zillion people into showing little cannons
trying to hit each other and having easier input. Well, a ton-o-players
playing it. Could use orientation to aim cannon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>johann sabastian joust?</p>
<p>johann sabastian joust is a game played with move controllers
where you try not to move the controller too much or you&#39;re out.
Other players try to make you move to fast knocking you out while
at the same time trying not to get taken out themselves.</p>
<p>HTML5 allows access to the accelerometers of the phone so it
should be possible ot make a similar game with HFT.</p>
<p>Apparently they aren&#39;t happy about clones</p>
</li>
<li><p>Games where each player gets a different contoller.</p>
<p>Players have different roles</p>
</li>
<li><p>quiz</p>
<p>send question Q + 4 answers, display on phone and on game. On game show counts
In 10 seconds show correct answer and winner on game and on phone?
Make sure answers after game has moved on do not affect results
Add score for players</p>
</li>
<li><p>Device orientation game, each player is assigned a piece of a shape, they have
to rotate their device to get the shape to line up (ie, jigsaw puzzle). Anytime
a new player is added the current shape is subdivided.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use device motion to play tennis like Wii (shake controller to return ball)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use the Speech Synthesis API</p>
<p>Players plug in headphones and put them in just one ear. The game sends commands/advice/direction
to the controller which instructs each player secretly using the speech API. This way they
can look at the game (the TV) and still get individual and private instruction on what to do.</p>
<p>Not sure the speech API is available on phones but you could use audio files
&quot;Walk forward&quot;, &quot;turn left&quot;, &quot;jump&quot;, &quot;wave&quot;, &quot;tap the person on your right&quot;
or longer &quot;You&#39;re the spy. Try to find the player with the red screen and press it&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grab for all</p>
<p>Just put stuff on the screen, people grab it as fast as they can (same controls as simple?)
or maybe a grid of buttons? Characters that rotate and jump? Highest score wins. Bombs
fail</p>
</li>
<li><p>Skeet ball or mega bowling</p>
<p>Everyone uses their phone to flick their ball up the screen trying to get more points or knock over more pins</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nation ball / Dodge Ball</p>
<p>players in the middle must dog things. Players knocked out throw things in to knock other players out</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go on adventure in the room.</p>
<p>Your phone lists what you need to find and what you have to give. People go around the room
trying to find the next thing in their fetch quest</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use led tapes across room to visually display portals. Jump in portal on 1 computer, see light
go across tape. Arrive at other computer</p>
</li>
<li><p>draw pattern, thing follows pattern</p>
</li>
<li><p>sequence across phones. Each phone screams at random?</p>
</li>
</ul>

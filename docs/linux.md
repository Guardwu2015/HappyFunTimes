Installing HappyFunTimes in Linux
=================================

I haven't had time to make a Linux installer. In fact I'm a Linux noob
when it comes to installers.

But, you can install it manually by following these steps

*   clone the repo `git clone git://github.com/greggman/happyfuntimes`
*   Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org). I was using 0.10.29
*   Open a shell
*   cd into the root of the repo you cloned (eg. `cd HappyFunTimes`)
*   type `npm install` which will install needed node modules locally
*   type `node server/server.js --app-mode` which will start the server.

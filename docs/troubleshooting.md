## Common Issues

### Phones can't connect

*   Are they on the same WiFi / same router as the game?

    HappyFunTimes requires the phones to be able to talk directly
    to the system running the game so the first thing to do is
    check the phones are on the same WiFi

    Additionally Corporate WiFi and Internet Cafe WiFi is often
    configured so that phone can not connect to computers.
    HappyFunTimes, in general, only supports home routers.

*   Does the game have pemission to access the internet?

    On Windows in particular, the first time a game (or Unity) is run
    Windows will pop up a window asking to give the game permission
    to access the internet or not. If you said *no* or if the system
    is configured to automically deny access then you need to go into
    your Windows Firefall settings and grant access
